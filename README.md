# Monte-carlo-simulation-to-create-data-for-power-systems-security-classification

1. Solves AC power flow (ACPF) for a 9 bus system for given number of iterations. The 9 bus system data has been loaded using the PYPOWER model for python.
2. The chosen number of iterations is 5000.  
3. Python's multiprocessing module has been used to parallely process 1000 iterations at a time on 5 CPU cores simultaneously.
4. The cloud computing resources provided to UNC Charlotte students has been utilized for the parallel processing. 
5. The total computing time is approximately 5 minutes
